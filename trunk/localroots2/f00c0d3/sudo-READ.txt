Package: sudo
Version: 1.7.4p4-2
Severity: important
Hi,
normally sudo doesn't allow to change the GID only:
	$ sudo -g staff id
	Sorry, user alexander is not allowed to execute '/usr/bin/id' as alexander:staff on alexander.

The solution for this is to change the %sudo entry in /etc/sudoers like
this:
	%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
This line has been the default in sid for over a month now (see
#602699[1]). However the above line seems to have some serious, unwanted
side-effects:
If you normally use sudo, you're asked to re-authenticate yourself,
typically via password:
	$ sudo -u root id
	[sudo] password for alexander: 
	uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

But if you only want to change the GID, sudo DOES NOT ask for a
password, even not if you explicitly reset the time stamp:
	$ sudo -g staff id
	uid=1000(alexander) gid=50(staff) groups=1000(alexander),27(sudo),112(fuse)
	$ sudo -k
	$ sudo -g staff id
	uid=1000(alexander) gid=50(staff) groups=1000(alexander),27(sudo),112(fuse)

IMHO this is a security issue[2], since it allows privilege escalation
without asking for a password. Either this bug should be fixed[3] or
sudo should stop asking for a password completely. The current behavior
is inconsistent and violates the principle of least surprise.

try sudo -i id , itll work same way to... i tested this, works :) makesure you use a system wich has sudo and su installed, and, i was able to own a 2011 kernel with this bug... so it is not some bs... -xd
