Hi ppl,

_Manpage Lookup_ is a PHP class that helps you to build a "manpage"
frontend in php. It is powered by Andy (http://php.amnuts.com).

The script _class.manpagelookup.php_ was vulnerable to a directory
transversal bug (because of leaks is input validation) that could lead
to disclose any readable (by the httpd process id) files on the remote
server.

The problem was located in the function buildManPage(), the $cmd
variable was not filtered enough and the path of any file to open could
be given across the user input.

Exploiting this issue was easy: 
http://www.foo.com/manpage/index.php?command=/etc/resolv.conf

The vulnerability has now been fixed by Andy. All people who are running
this script should upgrade asap (http://php.amnuts.com).

Best regards,
